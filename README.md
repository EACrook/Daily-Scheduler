# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Work Day Scheduler allows you to keep track of your todo's on an hourly basis for a standard work day. 

## Usage
Clicking on the hour's text box will allow you to enter in your task. If the hour has passed, the line is red and will not let you edit. If the hour has not passed, the hour will be green and allow you to edit the task.
